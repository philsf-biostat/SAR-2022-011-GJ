# Context

## Objectives

## Hypotheses

## Study design

# Data

```{r cleaning, include=FALSE}
source("scripts/input.R", encoding = 'UTF-8')
```

## Raw data

## Analytical dataset

All variables in the analytical set were labeled according to the raw data provided and values were labeled according to the data dictionary for the preparation of production-quality results tables and figures.

After the cleaning process `r ncol(analytical)` variables were included in the analysis with `r nrow(analytical)` observations.
Table 1 shows the structure of the analytical dataset.

```{r analytical data}
analytical_mockup %>%
  pander(caption = "**Table 1** Analytical dataset structure after variable selection and cleaning.")
```

The analytical dataset will be included in the private version of the report, and will be omitted from the public version of the report.

# Study variables

## Primary and secondary outcomes

**Specification of outcome measures** (Zarin, 2011):

1. (Domain)
2. (Specific measurement)
3. (Specific metric)
4. (Method of aggregation)

**Primary outcome**

## Covariates

# Statistical methods

## Statistical analyses

### Descriptive analyses

The epidemiological profile of the study participants will be described.
Demographic
(sex, age and BMI)
and clinical variables
<!-- ( [vars] ) -->
will be described as
mean (SD)
<!-- median (IQR) -->
or as counts and proportions (%), as appropriate.
The distributions of participants' characteristics will be summarized in tables and visualized in exploratory plots.

### Inferential analyses

All comparisons between groups will be performed as univariate analyses.
Continuous variables will be compared between groups with the
independent t test with Welch correction.
<!-- paired t test. -->
<!-- Wilcoxon test. -->
Differences in distribution of categorical variables will be assessed with the
Fisher exact test.
<!-- chi-square test. -->
<!-- McNemar test. -->

<!-- All inferential analyses will be performed in the statistical models (described in the next section). -->

### Statistical modeling

### Missing data

No missing data imputation will be performed.
All evaluations will be performed as complete case analyses.

## Significance and Confidence Intervals

All analyses will be performed using the significance level of 5%.
All significance hypothesis tests and confidence intervals computed will be
two-tailed.
<!-- left-tailed. -->
<!-- right-tailed. -->

## Study size and Power

```{r}
n <- analytical %>%
  count(group) %>%
  pull(n)
n1 <- n[1]
n2 <- n[2]
total <- sum(n)
d <- pwr::pwr.t2n.test(n1 = n1, n2 = n2, power = .8, sig.level = .05)$d %>%
  format.float()
d <- pwr::pwr.t.test(n = total/2, power = .8, sig.level = .05)$d %>%
  format.float()
```

<!-- Study groups were balanced and the total sample size was `r total` including all groups. -->

<!-- Study groups were not balanced with -->
<!-- group1 with `r n1` participants -->
<!-- and -->
<!-- group2 with `r n2` participants -->
<!-- with a total study size of `r total`. -->
<!-- This power analysis adjusts for different group sizes. -->

<!-- With these group sizes a t test can detect an effect size as large as -->
<!-- **d = `r d`** -->
<!-- with 80% power and 5% significance level (Cohen, 1988). -->

N/A

## Statistical packages

This analysis will be performed using statistical software `R` version `r getRversion()`.
