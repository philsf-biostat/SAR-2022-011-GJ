# Results

## Study population and follow up

The raw database contained 10588 surveys, of which 1183 incomplete cases were removed.
Of the complete cases 1920 participants did not agree nor disagree with at least one of the survey questions.
These did not meet the inclusion criteria and were also removed from the analysis.
After the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied the final number of surveys in the analysis is 7485.
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the surveys included in the final analysis.

One third of the employees at NASA are women
(36.4%, Table 1).
Both survey questions
addressed in this study showed most NASA employees demonstrated high levels of satisfaction when the survey was conducted.
The proportion of employees that agree or strongly agree with the satisfaction question
(q1 -- I am given a real opportunity to improve my skills in my organization)
was 96.8%.
The proportion of employees that agree or strongly agree with leadership commitment
(q21 -- Supervisors in my work unit support employee development)
was 98.0%.
Figure 1 shows how both sexes answered these questions.

</div>

Men and women tended to answer the satisfaction question at the same rates in 2020.
Of the 7246 NASA employees that are in agreement with the satisfaction question,
36.3% were women,
and of the 239 employees that are in disagreement,
women were 38.9% (Figure 1).

# Observations and Limitations

# Conclusions

One third of NASA employees in this study are women.
Both men and women tended to derive the satisfaction at the workplace in similar rates in 2020.
