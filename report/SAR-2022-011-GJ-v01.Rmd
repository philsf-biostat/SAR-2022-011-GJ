## Variables

### Primary and secondary outcomes

### Covariates

## Statistical analyses

This analysis was performed using statistical software `R` version `r getRversion()`.

# Results

## Study population and follow up

The raw database contained `r Nobs_orig` surveys, of which `r N_incomplete` incomplete cases were removed.
Of the complete cases `r N_drop3` participants did not agree nor disagree with at least one of the survey questions.
These did not meet the inclusion criteria and were also removed from the analysis.
After the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied the final number of surveys in the analysis is `r Nobs_final`.
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the surveys included in the final analysis.

```{r tab_desc}
tab_desc %>%
  as_kable(
    caption = "**Table 1** caption"
  )
```

```{r fig1, fig.cap="**Figure 1** Dichotomized survey responses, by sex."}
# ![Age](../figures/outcome.png)
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/outcome.png", error = FALSE)
```

## Inferential analysis

```{r tab_inf}
tab_inf %>%
  as_kable(
    caption = "**Table 2** caption"
  )
